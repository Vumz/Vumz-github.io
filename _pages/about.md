Hi, I'm a Software Engineer at Microsoft working in the Surface SW/FW product team. I graduated from Georgia Tech with a Computer Science degree and a 4.0 GPA. My interests lie in robotics, transportation, and augmented reality to name a few, but have a wide variety of experiences ranging from firmware to app developement.
