Hi, I'm a rising junior undergraduate student at Georgia Tech pursuing a Computer Science major and Robotics minor. My interests lie in robotics and software developement, specifically for automation and app/web developement, as well as machine learning and cybersecurity.  

Please check out my [portfolio](https://vumz.github.io/portfolio/) and [CV](https://vumz.github.io/portfolio/)!
