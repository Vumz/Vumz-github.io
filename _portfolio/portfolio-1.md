**Date**: August 2016 â€“ January 2017

**Platforms used**: Django, HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap 

**Summary**: Lend Formal is an online marketplace for individuals to lend and rent formal wear. Making formal wear more affordable and accessible for individuals of all economic backgrounds was the goal by utilizing the sharing economy. Individuals who own formal clothing can post their clothes for rent on the website and customers can rent out these clothing items for a much lower price than at retail stores while still giving the provider a cut of the sales. HTML5 and CSS were used to create the front end of the website along with the Bootstrap UI kit. The backend was handled using the Django python based web framework in order to keep the website scalable as well as easily manage the SQL database. Used the Model View Controller method to design the user interface of the website (Design picture seen below).
