**Date**: March 2020 – April 2020

**Skills/Platforms used**: Python, Google Maps API

**Summary**: A tool to aid volunteer efforts in sourcing PPE for hospital workers in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Generates a spreadsheet containing contact information for sites likely to have PPE nearby a location of interest so that these efforts can be efficiently coordinated. Quickly expanded to search for potential child care workers to care for the healthcare workers’ children whose schools have shut down. These volunteer efforts have been coordinated by the NYC Childcare Match along with medical students from Columbia, Cornell, and NYU (with more onboarding). An initial look at the contact success rate shows that out of the locations that responded, approximately 70% were interested in helping out.
