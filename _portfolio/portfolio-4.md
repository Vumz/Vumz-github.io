**Date**: December 2017 â€“ present

**Skills/Platforms used**: HTML, CSS, Flask, Python

**Summary**: This project is meant to seamlessly convert a user's Apple Music playlists to their Spotify account without needing to pay for the service or download anything to their phone/computer. While the core functionality works from the terminal, I'm currently making a MEAN based website to allow for playlist conversion accross both Apple Music and Spotify.
