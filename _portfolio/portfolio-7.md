**Date**:  June 2013- September 2013

**Skills/Platforms used**: HTML5, IntelXDK, AWS

**Summary**: In high school I used to carpool everyday to save gas and time for a 45 minute commute. After seeing the difficulties of carpooling, I developed a mobile app to ease and promote carpooling to and from school. It was written in HTML5 using Intel XDK framework to accelerate development on multiple mobile platforms. Amazon’s AWS was used to store carpool data and enable daily interactions. In addition to ease carpooling, the app promoted carpooling by tracking fuel and CO2 emissions saved as a result of carpooling.
Key features:
* A website to create and schedule carpools
* A mobile app for daily carpooling needs
  * Know location of driver and time of arrival
  * Know who is doing drop-off and pickup
  * Be able to quickly call/chat with other carpool mates or drivers
  * Record if you don’t need a ride 
  * Request a ride from other carpools in case you need a ride
